## Plush Compiler Project

### Author: Bruno Liu fc56297

### Structure of the project
The project as 5 folders of examples:
    maxRangeSquared --> professor default folder
    maxRangeSquared --> my examples
    bubbleSort --> my examples
    fibonacci --> my examples
    leapYear --> my examples
    exampleForImports --> my example for the phase 5 implementation, imports

The project also has the following files:
    tokens.py --> file with the tokens used in the lexical analysis
    rules.py --> file with the rules used in the syntactic analysis
    semantics.py --> file with the rules used in the semantic analysis
    codeGen.py --> file for the code generation
    plush_compliler.py --> file with everything together, the lexer,parsing, semantic analysis and code generation
    
    runProgram.sh --> script to run the program generated by the plush compiler
    setup.sh --> script to build the docker image and run the docker with an interactive terminal
    Dockerfile --> file to build the docker image
    README.md --> this file

### How to run the program
First, run the setup.sh script, to build the docker image and run the docker with an interactive terminal
After opening the docker interactive terminal
Use the plush.sh to run the examples and generate the .ll, these are some of the combination that are possible:
For bubbleSort:
    ./plush.sh <optionally add the tag "--tree" here > bubbleSort/0_valid/bubbleSort.pl
    ./plush.sh <optionally add the tag "--tree" here > bubbleSort/1_lexical_error/bubbleSort1.pl
For fibonacci:
    ./plush.sh <optionally add the tag "--tree" here > fibonacci/0_valid/fibonacci.pl
For leapYear:
    ./plush.sh <optionally add the tag "--tree" here > leapYear/0_valid/leapYear.pl
For exampleForImports:
    ./plush.sh <optionally add the tag "--tree" here > exampleForImports/main.pl

After running the plush if you want to execute the program run the following line:
    runProgram.sh
additionally if you want to remove the files generated by runProgram.sh you can run the code with:
    runProgram.sh --rmaf
this will execute the program, and remove the files after the execution.
