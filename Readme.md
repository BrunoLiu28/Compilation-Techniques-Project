## Plush Compiler Project
The project was created for the compilation techniques subject in college. <br>
Grade: 19/20

### Author: Bruno Liu fc56297

### Structure of the project
The project as 5 folders of examples:

    maxRangeSquared --> professor default folder
    bubbleSort --> my examples
    fibonacci --> my examples
    leapYear --> my examples
    exampleForImports --> my example for the phase 5 implementation, imports

The project also has the following files:

    tokens.py --> file with the tokens used in the lexical analysis
    rules.py --> file with the rules used in the syntactic analysis
    semantics.py --> file with the rules used in the semantic analysis
    codeGen.py --> file for the code generation
    plush_compliler.py --> file with everything together, the lexer,parsing, semantic analysis and code generation
    
    functions.c --> file with the functions implemented in c used in the plush programs
    runProgram.sh --> script to run the program generated by the plush compiler
    setup.sh --> script to build the docker image and run the docker with an interactive terminal
    Dockerfile --> file to build the docker image
    README.md --> this file

### How to run the program
First, run the **./setup.sh** script, to build the docker image and run the docker with an interactive terminal
After opening the docker interactive terminal
Use the **./plush.sh** to run the examples and generate the .ll, if any error is found, it will be printed. These are some of the combination that are possible:
For bubbleSort:

    ./plush.sh --tree bubbleSort/0_valid/bubbleSort.pl
    ./plush.sh --tree bubbleSort/1_lexical_error/bubbleSort1.pl

For fibonacci:

    ./plush.sh --tree fibonacci/0_valid/fibonacci.pl

For leapYear:

    ./plush.sh --tree leapYear/0_valid/leapYear.pl

For exampleForImports:

    ./plush.sh --tree exampleForImports/main.pl

The tag --tree is used to print to STDOUT a JSON representation of the AST.
After running the plush if you want to execute the program run the following line:

    ./runProgram.sh

additionally if you want to remove the files generated by runProgram.sh you can run the code with:

    ./runProgram.sh --rmaf

this will execute the program, and remove the files after the execution.
