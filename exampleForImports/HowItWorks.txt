In this example we have 3 file, where:
    "main.pl" needs the "fibonacci" function, and "main.pl" imports everything from "second.pl"
    "second.pl" has some functions and a main and imports just the function "fibonacci" from "third.pl"
    "third.pl" has the function "fibonacci"

Because of this sequence of imports it is possible to run the "main.pl" because it will have the "fibonacci" function imported
